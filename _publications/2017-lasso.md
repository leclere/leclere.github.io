In high dimensional settings, sparse structures are crucial for efficiency, both in term of
memory, computation and performance. It is customary to consider `1 penalty to enforce
sparsity in such scenarios. Sparsity enforcing methods, the Lasso being a canonical example,
are popular candidates to address high dimension. For efficiency, they rely on tuning a parameter
trading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lasso theory to hold this tuning parameter should
be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is often unknown in practice. A possible remedy
is to jointly optimize over the regression parameter as well as over the noise level. This has been
considered under several names in the literature: Scaled-Lasso, Square-root Lasso, Concomitant
Lasso estimation for instance, and could be of interest for uncertainty quantification. In this
work, after illustrating numerical difficulties for the Concomitant Lasso formulation, we propose
a modification we coined Smoothed Concomitant Lasso, aimed at increasing numerical stability.
We propose an efficient and accurate solver leading to a computational cost no more expensive
than the one for the Lasso. We leverage on standard ingredients behind the success of fast
Lasso solvers: a coordinate descent algorithm, combined with safe screening rules to achieve
speed efficiency, by eliminating early irrelevant features.
