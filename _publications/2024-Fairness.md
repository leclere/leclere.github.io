This paper studies how to aggregate prosumers (or large consumers) and their
collective decisions in electricity markets, with a focus on fairness. Fairness is
essential for prosumers to participate in aggregation schemes. Some prosumers
may not be able to access the energy market directly, even though it would
be beneficial for them. Therefore, new companies offer to aggregate them and
promise to treat them fairly. This leads to a fair resource allocation problem.
We propose to use acceptability constraints to guarantee that each prosumer gains
from the aggregation. Moreover, we aim to distribute the costs and benefits fairly,
taking into account the multi-period and uncertain nature of the problem. Rather
than using financial mechanisms to adjust for fairness issues, we focus on various
objectives and constraints, within decision problems, that achieve fairness by
design. We start from a simple single-period and deterministic model, and then
generalize it to a dynamic and stochastic setting using, e.g., stochastic dominance
constraints.
