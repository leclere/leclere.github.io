We consider the problem of jointly optimizing the daily production planning and energy supply man-
agement of an industrial complex, with manufacturing processes, renewable energies and energy storage
systems. It is naturally formulated as a mixed-integer multistage stochastic problem. This problem is
challenging for three main reasons: there is a large number of time steps (typically 24), renewable en-
ergies are uncertain and uncontrollable, and we need binary variables modeling hard constraints. We
discuss various solution strategies, in particular Model Predictive Control, Dynamic Programming, and
heuristics based on the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm. We compare these strategies
on two variants of the problem: with or without day-ahead energy purchases.
