For multistage stochastic programming problems with stagewise in-
dependent uncertainty, dynamic programming algorithms calculate poly-
hedral approximations for the value functions at each stage. The SDDP
algorithm provides piecewise linear lower bounds, in the spirit of the L-
shaped algorithm, and corresponding upper bounds took a longer time
to appear. One strategy uses the primal dynamic programming recur-
sion to build inner approximations of the value functions, while a second
one builds lower approximations for the conjugate of the value functions.
The resulting dynamic programming recursion for the conjugate value
functions do not decompose over scenarios, which suggests a Lagrangian
relaxation. We prove that this Lagrangian relaxation corresponds exactly
to the inner upper bounds for a natural choice of multipliers
