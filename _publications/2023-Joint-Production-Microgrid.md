We consider the problem of jointly optimizing the daily production planning and energy supplymanagement of an industrial complex, with manufacturing processes, renewable energies and energystorage system. It is naturally formulated as a mixed-integer multistage stochastic problem. This problem is challenging for three main reasons: there is a large number of time steps(typically 24); renewable energies are uncertain and uncontrollable, and we need binary variablesmodeling hard constraints. We discuss various solution strategies, in particular Model PredictiveControl, Dynamic Programming, and heuristics based on the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming algorithm.We compare these strategies on two variants of the problem: with or without day-ahead energy purchases.
