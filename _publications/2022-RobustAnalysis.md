This work proposes a novel theoretical framework of robust limit analysis i.e. the computation of limit loads of structures in presence of uncertainties using limit analysis and robust optimization theories. We first derive generic robust limit analysis formulations in the case of uncertain material strength properties. We discuss various ways of modeling uncertain strength properties and introduce the notion of robust strength criteria. We formulate static and adjustable robust counterparts of the corresponding uncertain limit analysis problems. Depending on the chosen strength uncertainty model, we also discuss tractable reformulations or approximations which can be implemented numerically using conic programming solvers. Building upon these results, we also derive robust limit analysis formulations in presence of loading uncertainties. Finally, various applications illustrate the versatility of the proposed framework including the derivation of a robust Mohr-Coulomb criterion with uncertain cohesion and friction angle, the computation of limit load of a structure subject to the partial loss of some components, or the limit load of a truss structure under multiple load uncertainties.
