We prove the almost-sure convergence of a class of sampling-based nested decomposition algorithms for multistage stochastic
convex programs in which the stage costs are general convex functions of the decisions and uncertainty is modelled by a
scenario tree. As special cases, our results imply the almost-sure convergence of stochastic dual dynamic programming,
cutting-plane and partial-sampling (CUPPS) algorithm, and dynamic outer-approximation sampling algorithms when applied to
problems with general convex cost functions.
