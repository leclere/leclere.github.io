Risk-averse multi-stage problems and their applications are gaining interest in
various fields of applications. Under convexity assumptions, the resolution of
these problems can be done with trajectory following dynamic programming
algorithms like Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) to access a
deterministic lower bound, and dual SDDP for deterministic upper bounds.
In this paper, we leverage the dual SDDP algorithm to compute a policy with
guaranteed risk-adjusted performance for multistage stochastic linear problems.
