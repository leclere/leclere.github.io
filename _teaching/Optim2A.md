### Urban transportation transport analysis and introduction to game theory

[slides](../files/teaching/ROT/ROT-1.pdf)

- We present the urban transport analysis framework
- We recall the Braess's paradox
- We give essential game theory definitions

### Shortest Path algorithms

[slides](../files/teaching/ROT/ROT-2.pdf)

- We give essential graph definitions, and define the shortest path problem
- We present three algorithms:
  - Djikstra
  - Bellman
  - A*

### Wardrop equilibrium and price of anarchy

[slides](../files/teaching/ROT/ROT-3.pdf)

- We recall some optimization background (Convexity, KKT's conditions)
- We introduce the notion of Wardrop user equilibrium
- We show that the user equilibrium can be found as the minimum of a convex optimization problem
- We define and bound the price of anarchy

### Numerical methods for finding user equilibrium and social optimum

[slides](../files/teaching/ROT/ROT-4.pdf)

We have shown that finding the user equilibrium (or the social optimum) is equivalent to solving a convex optimization problem under polyhedral constraints.
Thus, in this course we study numerical methods to find it.

- Numerical methods for univariate optimization
- Conditional gradient (a.k.a Franck-Wolfe) algorithm
- Application to equilibrium computation and comparison to known heuristics

### Practical work

### Other transport related operation research problems
