This is a 3rd year course about the use of Operation Research in Transport problem. 
The subject being incredibly vast we actually focus on traffic assignement problem : knowing where people want to go, how is everybody going to choose its path, the traffic equilibrate and finally how much traffic jam are we going to observe.

To do so we explore the incredibly simple and somewhat mind bungling Braess's Paradox : in some case suppressing a road actually diminish the travel time for everybody ! 

On the way we discuss basic game theory (Nash Equilibrium, Prisonner's dilemna, Pareto efficiency), shortest path problem and algorithms (Djikstra's, Bellman's, A*), Wardrop Equilibrium and numerical method to find it (Conditional gradient method a.k.a Franck Wolfe methods). 
The course is topped-up by a practical work and various intervention showcasing other transport related operation research problems.
